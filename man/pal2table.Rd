\title{Color Palette to Table}
\usage{
pal2table(x, pch = 21:24, pch2 = c(19, 15, 18, 17), alpha = 220,
  pal = colors)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of factors}

\item{pch}{A list of symbols to be used}

\item{pch2}{a second list of symbols}

\item{alpha}{The transparency value for the color}

\item{pal}{A vector of colors. Default is built-in color palette}
}
\value{
An object of class pal2table.
 Dataframe with following columns.
\item{class}{names of the factors} 
\item{col}{assigned color} 
\item{pch}{assigned symbol} 
\item{pch2}{assigned second symbol}
}
\description{
Creates a data frame assigning colors and symbols to factors
}
\details{
Aim of the the functions pal2table and match2table is to provide an easy framework for assigning same colors and symbols for same factors
in different plots. Matching colors and symbols to factors is complicated when different graphs do not have the same factors in same order.
pal2table will create a data frame assigning colors and symbols to factors. An object of type pal2table is created that will be interpreted
by match2table. The later function can be used to create a vector of colors and symbols to be used by plot graphical parameters col, bg, fg, or pch.
The function will assign the colors and symbols matching the name of factors in the data frame to the provided vector of names. 
pal2table has a plot method which will plot the assigned colors and symbols together with the names of the factors.
The built-in color palette is modified from 'brocolors' from package 'broman' by Karl W Broman. It accepts changing the alpha value using the argument alpha.
Note that using a different color palette with argument pal will probably inabilitate the alpha modulation. Please adjust alpha in your palette forehand.
