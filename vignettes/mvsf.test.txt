## Multivariate structure test
If you don't have RFtools, install from <a "href=https://github.com/pmartinezarbizu/RFtools target="_blank">here</a>

```{r}
library(RFtools)
```
      
Note that you need to transpose your dataset, because functions in `vegan` and `RFtools` assume observations as lines and variables as columns (opposite as we have now).
Use function `t()`.


```{r}
tmeio <- t(meio[,9:27])
```

Change the column names of transposed matrix to meaningful names
```{r}
colnames(tmeio) <- paste('ASV',1:ncol(tmeio),sep='')
```

We use function `MVSF.test` from package `RFtools`. This is a multivariate structure test using randomForest. It compares the OOB (out of bag) classification error against an empirical null model.

```{r}
mv.test <- MVSF.test(as.factor(locations),tmeio)
```

```{r}
plot(mv.test)
```
